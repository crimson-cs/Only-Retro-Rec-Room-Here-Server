# RebornRec - Localhost Server Software to revive older versions of Rec Room
## About RebornRec
RebornRec is a locally hosted server for older versions of Rec Room ranging from 2016 to 2020, containing many extra features alongside being able to emulate Rec Room's old servers.

As of right now, RebornRec is not open-source, the files you see in the repo are files the server will download and use as it's running.
## How do I use this server/that feature?

More info on getting the server running and certain features will be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/aqquad/RebornRec/wiki).
